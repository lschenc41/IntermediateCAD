# IntermediateCAD
My IntermediateCAD assignments, consisting of models of a spool and telescope that were made to learn how to use design tables and advanced and mechanical mates.

## Design Tables
### Objective
The objective of this assignment was to make six configurations of a spool shape. The shape itself consists of a cylinder with the radius of the top and bottom being larger than the radius of the rest of the part, along with a varying number of holes on the top and bottom circles. The main goal was to learn how to make configurations using design tables.
### Visuals
The 6 spool configurations:\

### Obstacles
While the construction of the spool was relatively simple for me, I ran into some difficulty when making the configurations. I was able to create the design table, but after inputting all of the values it didn't work. Thankfully, it didn't take long for me to realize that the sizes were supposed to on the left side of the table rather than the top, which I had done initially.
## Advanced and Mechanical Mates

### Obstacles
I was relatively familiar with mates after making a Useless Box last year, so I was confident that I could mate all of the parts without much help. Because of this, I skimmed through the instructions and missed the part where it says to use a tangent mate to connect the pin with the end of the medium configuration. I had never used a tangent mate before, so I tried using a standard mate and quickly figured out that it wasn't working. I tried deleting the mate and trying it again, convinced that I just clicked the wrong face somewhere, but I still couldn't get it to work. After a couple minutes I finally decided it would be a good idea to read through the instructions again more thoroughly, and got it to work after using a tangent mate.
